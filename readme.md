README.MD

This is a javascript applet to recognize the location of the browser and change the webpage.

The idea is to build location awareness into public sites. If an end user is standing in a store or museum, the webpage should be able to identify that and offer them content more relavent to their need.

This is:
a) My first JavaScript app
b) My first public Git repo

So be gentle!
