README.MD

This is a javascript applet to recognize the location of the browser and change the webpage.

The idea is to build location awareness into public sites. If an end user is standing in a store or museum, the webpage should be able to identify that and offer them content more relavent to their need.

This is:
a) My first JavaScript app
b) My first public Git repo

So be gentle!

Background:
This attempt is to build geo intelligence into web pages that can benefit the user by giving them different content when they are at a specific location.

There was a map counter at our local park that had a pin on it that said “You are here”. When we walked out the door and headed towards the trail, the paper map didn’t update. More of us are walking around with smartphones, so why not lower the burden on handouts, fliers and maps at the entrance and potentially just point people with these devices to the sites homepage and let technology handle the rest.

I always used our Museum as a prime use case: When I am there, a map and current exhibitions are priority; but it also it gives the museum the opportunity to offer audio tours and links to additional content - More content, without all the paper. Print something out and it will be obsolete, be it an hour from now or 1 year.  So this was a challenge for me to experiment with opportunities to make our website work better in these contexts.
